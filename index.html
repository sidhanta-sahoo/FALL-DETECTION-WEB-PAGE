        <h2>Why fall detection?</h2>
        <p>
          Every five minutes, a person over the age of 65 ends up in the emergency department (ED) after a fall (Source: safety.nl). Falling is the most common cause of injury in the elderly. Each year, more than 5,000 elderly people die as a result of a fall. So that's 14 people a day, every day. Most elderly people die from dehydration and/or hypothermia because they have been lying on the floor for hours. It is expected that the number of A&E visits for injuries after a fall in the elderly will increase by 50% within 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fall accident has a major impact on the self-reliance of the elderly. After a fall (or when the risk of falling is high), it is sometimes not possible to continue living at home. The quality of life can also decrease after a fall incident. For this reason, we have added fall detection to viQtor.
